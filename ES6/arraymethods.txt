In summary, map is used for transforming elements in an array and 
creating a new array with the transformed values, while filter is 
used for selecting elements from an array based on a condition and 
creating a new array containing only the selected elements. Both 
methods are non-destructive, meaning they don't modify the 
original array.

Array Methods:
    map => Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.
    filter => Returns the entire elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.
    find => helps us to find a sing object in the array
