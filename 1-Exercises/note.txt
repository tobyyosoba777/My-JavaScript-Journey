const maxValue = (arr) => {
    return Math.max(arr)
}
console.log(maxValue([1,2,4,5,6]))

In this example, you are passing the entire array arr as an argument to Math.max. 
The Math.max function expects individual numeric arguments, not an array. Therefore, 
when you pass an array, it treats the entire array as a single argument, and since 
it's not a valid numeric value, it results in NaN (Not a Number).


BUT ======>>>>
const maxValue = (arr) => {
    return Math.max(..arr)
}
console.log(maxValue([1,2,3,4,5]))

This works because 

the spread (...) operator is used to spread the elements of the array as individual 
arguments to the Math.max function. This allows Math.max to properly compare and find 
the maximum value among the numeric elements in the array.
