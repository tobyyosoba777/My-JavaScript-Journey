Node is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code

JavaScript is a Dynamic/ Dynamically Typed Language Meaning the type of value assigned 
can be changed, Unlike static languages, in dynamically typed languages the typeof value 
assigned to each variable will be detected on runtime 

Category of types in JavaScript
Primitives/ Value Types:
*String
*Numbers
*Undefined
*Boolean

*Function


Arrays:
Square Brackets are called array literals and they indicate an empty array
In JavaScript you can store different types(DataTypes) in an array and the length is dynamic
Technically, an array is an object in JavaScript
An array is a data structure that we use to represent a list of item

let selectedColors = ['red', 'blue'];
console.log(selectedColors.length);   Will Return the length of the array



//Array Manipulation
Push is an array method used to add items to an array after the array has been assigned its values array.push("hello") ,, array.push(["hello"])

Pop() Removes the last element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, undefined is returned and the array is not modified.
