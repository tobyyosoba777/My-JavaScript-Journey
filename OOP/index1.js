//When you write a code like this below
let x = {};
//JavaScript will translate it into this: let x = new Object();

//Constructors 
new String(); //For creating strings '' "" `` String literals, using the string literals is better and cleaner
new Boolean(); // True False
new Number(); //1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ...





//Every Object has a constructor property and that references the function that was used to create that object
